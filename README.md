## Overview
This project leverages deep learning techniques to classify skin cancer lesions accurately. Utilizing state-of-the-art models and methods, we aim to contribute to early detection efforts that are vital for patient care.

## üß† Project Highlights
- **Custom CNN**: Built from scratch for a baseline classification task.
- **Transfer Learning**: Incorporates pre-trained architectures:
  - **ResNet50**: A deep residual network for efficient feature extraction.
  - **VGG16**: A proven model for robust image classification tasks.

## üìä Dataset
We used the **HAM10000** dataset, containing 10,015 dermoscopic images of seven lesion types. Key preprocessing techniques include:
- **Normalization** for consistent input.
- **Class balancing** to address imbalanced data.

## üöÄ Features
- **End-to-End Workflow**: Includes preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
- **Transfer Learning**: Comparative analysis of different models on identical tasks.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Tracks accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
